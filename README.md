# Module 10

## Description

> Generated using module 9 project!

This is Adrian Jimenez's module 10 Team profile generator challenge submission.

I started this project off by first creating an employee class for all subsequent classes to extend from. Once that was complete, I was able to extend the methods and constructors to the rest of the employee classes I'd created, and then export those classes to have access to the methods across all files I imported them into. Once that was done, I created prompts for the user to enter data, and packaged the data into an array containing all employees the user entered. Using that data, I called a template script to take the data and format it as a template literal, then return it for use in another script. Said script imports the file system module and generates an index.html file as well as a style.css file into the dist/ folder containing all the employee data from the user.
